integrity contraints

1. attribute constraint, example data types on columns
2. key contraints, example primary keys
3. referential integrity constraints, example foreign keys

what is benefit of contraints?

1. make sure data structure
2. make data consistency and quality better

what is a key?

* attribute(s) that identify a record uniquely
* as long as attributes can be removed: superkey
* if no more attributes can be removed: minimal superkey or key

what is a superkey?

combination from all attribute columns

what is a key?

all element in superkey 

where the key is not unique then we remove key that is not unique

what is candidate key?

only one or combination from some attribute of all attribute unique can be the chosen key

example 

one candidate key with combination attribute

column a
column b 
column c
primary key(a,b)

column d 
column e 
primary key(a)

what is primary key?

key chosen from candidate key with unique and not null constraints

what is surrogate key?

primary key that chosen from combination some column

how many violations in referential integrity?

1. no action (default) -> throw an error
2. cascade -> delete all referencing records
3. restrict -> throw an error
4. set null -> set the referencing column to null
5. set default -> set the referencing column to its default value
